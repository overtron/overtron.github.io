An aspiring polymath. My passion is learning and helping other people to experience the joys of learning. It's cliche but I believe in the power of "teaching a person to fish".

This blog is a place to write about my ideas in order to structure my thoughts. Sharing my thoughts publicly opens my ideas up to criticism and will help me to further my passion for learning.
