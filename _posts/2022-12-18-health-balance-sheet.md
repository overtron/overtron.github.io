## your health balance sheet 

Fitness trackers have become commonplace in our lives. They automatically collect data about how active you are each day and some even collect health metrics like your resting heart rate. Many of the metrics that we tend to focus on are ones that change often as these are more engaging. I think it is just as important to take a look at snapshot metrics that change more slowly but paint a picture on how all your health decisions add up. I like to think of these as my Health Balance Sheet.

In case you're not familiar with the term balance sheet from the business world, let me explain. There are three financial statements that are critical to assessing the health of a business when reviewed over time: Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement. The Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement are alike in that they focus on how things have changed over a period of time. In contrast, a Balance Sheet is a snapshot of the business in time. If we compare these ideas to personal finance, your income tax form is like the income statement, it says how much money you made over a given period. Your bank account is like a Balance Sheet, it says how much money you have a specific point in time. This is an extreme simplification of the ideas behind those statements but it is enough background for our purposes.

Our "Income Statement" metrics are really helpful for managing the effort that we're putting into our heath goals. Our daily metrics add up to create the results we have at a given point in time. The challenge with these metrics is sometimes it is hard to know how they all add up. You might ask yourself, "did that week of overeating on vacation overweigh the 2 months of discipline beforehand". "Balance Sheet" metrics are how you answer those questions. 

Tracking your weight is the balance sheet metric that many of us are familiar with but it's an imprecise measure that is hard to interpret on its own. I was inspired to look into these ways of measuring my health because I've gained 20 pounds over the last 6 years but I still participate in a lot of high activity sports and consider myself relatively fit. Some of these "Balance Sheet" metrics helped me to see that I was in fact getting less fit and I wasn't just "putting on muscle" from my workouts. I am looking forward to tracking these metrics across 2023 to get more in touch with whether my health is improving or deteriorating.

## health balance sheet metrics

### waist-to-height ratio
__What:__ Circumference of your waist divided by your height

__Target:__ < 0.5. For example, if your 6 feet tall (72 inches) you waist should be no more than 36 inches in circumference

__Why:__ Is an easy way to estimate your visceral fat which is the fat that surrounds your organs. This is different from your subcutaneous fat that you can feel by pinching your skin. High amounts of visceral fat is a risk factor for many illnesses.

### waist-to-hip ratio
__What:__ Circumference of your waist divided by your height

__Target:__ Men <= 0.99. Women <= 0.90 [1]

__Why:__ This is another measure that approximates how much visceral fat you have by comparing your relative proportions.

### vo2 max
__What:__ Maximum rate of oxygen your body is able to use during exercise [2] [3]

__Target:__ Depends on sex and age

__Why:__ Is a measure of your cardiovascular health. Maintaining a strong heart and lungs are important as you age. This is "cardio"

### resting metabolic rate
__What:__ Test that measures how much energy your body burns when resting. Can also use a formula but it can be off by a decent amount [4]

__Target:__ N/A

__Why:__ This helps you to determine how many calories you should be targeting in your diet. There are for


### flexibility
__What:__ Various measures of flexibility (e.g. V-sit)

__Target:__ Differs per test but maintaining health baselines

__Why:__ Flexibility fades as you age if you don't work on it. Inflexible muscles are more prone to injury


### strength
__What:__ Various measurements of strength (1-rep max, max reps, vertical jump)

__Target:__ Differs per test

__Why:__ Measures how your strength is changing over time. Muscles decline as we age but also from infrequent use
